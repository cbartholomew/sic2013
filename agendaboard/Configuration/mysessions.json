And screw things up royally.<\/p>\n\n<p>But no worries. That&rsquo;s just how it is when you&rsquo;re dealing with things that haven&rsquo;t been done before.<\/p>\n\n<p>When Clark Kokich, chairman of Razorfish, and Larry Asher, creative director of Worker Bees, set out to write Do or Die &mdash; a hybrid book+app about how today&rsquo;s technology demands a new approach to marketing &mdash; they decided to embrace failure.&nbsp; In fact, Chapter 9 of Do or Die is subtitled, &ldquo;Failure is the new mark of success.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>By that measure, they welcomed a little toe-stubbing. But, in the spirit of transparency, Asher and Kokich say, in retrospect, that they had a true taste of failure. Their foible was underestimating the percentage of iPad owners in their target audience &mdash; an essential technology you need to read the book.<\/p>\n\n<p>Were they devastated? Not at all. The experimentation with a new form of publishing was a thrill. And they came away with lessons that will be the breeding ground of future innovations.<\/p>\n\n<p>So in this presentation, Larry will turn the tables on the conventional wisdom about risk avoidance and show you how great successes are often built on a foundation of failure. But, since success is clearly the preferable outcome, he&rsquo;ll also touch on these ideas for failure avoidance:<\/p>\n\n<p>- Avoid being blinded by the &ldquo;can&rsquo;t lose&rdquo; brilliance of your innovation<br \/>\n- Be honest when asked, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; so your supporters can give you valuable constructive criticism<br \/>\n- Don&rsquo;t let perfection get in the way of progress<\/p>",

However, brands need more than awareness to be successful and social advertising can help. With paid social media revenues expected to exceed $9.2 billion in 2016, this channel is gaining momentum in the advertising world. Given growing user bases and high engagement levels, top social networks are well-positioned to connect brands with consumers and deliver measurable results. As marketers rationalize social advertising as part of their overall paid media mix, new opportunities emerge to reach customers, create engagement, broaden brand awareness, encourage direct response, and ultimately generate revenue.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFrom Facebook to LinkedIn to Twitter, attendees will learn about key themes, trends, and content strategies for social advertising that can be leveraged to meet both direct response and engagement goals. The need for operational clarity within organizations and how &ldquo;social&rdquo; fits in to operationalize total paid, earned and owned strategies will also be discussed. Lastly, operational best practices and examples of customer ROI will be presented to show how social platforms can help build community, improve brand lift and conversion rates, mobilize followers, and improve the bottom line.<\/p>",

Often the problem lies in referring to first touch or last-click measurement as attribution, and that is simply incorrect.

When a consumer sees a commercial on TV, and then researches the product on an iPad, and then makes a purchase on a laptop, each step of that process played a specific role in the conversion. Customer path attribution looks at each of these touchpoints and gives credit where credit is due. Marketing strategies and campaigns are complex and require integrated efforts; as such, they need to be looked at as a whole entity.<\/p>\n\n<p>This presentation will address the misconceptions about attribution solutions, and clarify how all-inclusive the term truly is.

        "Abstract": "<p>In an age of ever-evolving digital solutions and technological innovations, with a global audience of connected consumers, we have to ask: why do good ideas sometimes turn bad?&nbsp; Why do the best intentions sometimes produce innovations that seem so misguided?&nbsp; Why do bad products happen to good people?&nbsp; Eric Duerr, co-founder of Extreme Arts + Sciences, has spent over a decade focusing on digital strategy and communications for some of the biggest companies in technology.&nbsp; In this talk, he offers insight that every innovator and entrepreneur with a dream and an engineering budget should hear: that when it comes to understanding the potential success of a new media technology, and technology more broadly, it takes more than numbers, more than marketing, and more than niche thinking.&nbsp; Disruption happens, when it happens at all, because of a complicated feedback loop between technology on the one hand, and social and psychological norms on the other.&nbsp; Extracting lessons from history, media theory, psychology, and anthropology, Mr. Duerr will explain how when it comes to products turning bad, innovators and entrepreneurs need to understand that media determine, but culture decides.<\/p>",

        "Summary": "2013 has proven to be one of the most transformative years for the search marketing industry. Paid search marketing continues to evolve with enhanced campaigns, increased targeting options, and much more. Meanwhile in organic search, Google has begun encrypting all searches, thus hiding all organic keyword referral data, and semantic search has gained a stronger foothold with Google&#8217;s new Hummingbird algorithm. Meet with Ben Lloyd and Ian Lurie, moderated by Rob Ousbey, as they discuss how measurement and tracking must evolve to accommodate these significant changes in search marketing.",
